# Storage

### Docker Storage

- Docker uses a layered architecture, in the Dockerfile for each command a layer is created which contains the changes from the previous layer, this is reflected in the size of the layers too
    - These image layers are read only and when a container is run, Docker creates a writeable layer, a container layer, the life of this layer lasts as long as the container runs, when the container stops all the changes and data in this layer are destroyed
- When you try to modify for example the source code of an application in the image layer, a copy of it is created in the container layer, this is called **copy-on-write** and changes will be lost in this case too when the container stops running
- To persist data you can create a volume with the `docker volume create $VOLUME_NAME` command and then mount this volume to the container with `docker run -v $VOLUME_NAME:$PATH_IN_CONTAINER $IMAGE`
    - This command creates a folder under the `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` directory
- If you don’t create a volume before running a container, Docker automatically creates the volume for you
- Volume mounting mounts the volume from the `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` directory while Bind mounting mounts a folder from a specified directory on the Docker host to the Docker container
- Using the `--mount` option is more preferred to the `-v` option as it is more verbose, for example: `docker run --mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql`
- Docker uses storage drivers to enable the layered architecture, for example AUFS, ZFS, BTRFS, Overlay, Overlay2
    - The storage driver used depends on the underlying OS, Ubuntu uses AUFS, Manjaro uses Overlay2

### Container Runtime Interface

- The CRI is a standard that defines how an orchestration solution like Kubernetes would communicate with container runtimes like Docker
- To extend support to different networking solutions, the Container Networking Interface was introduced, the Container Storage Interface was developed to support storage solutions
- The interfaces have to be implemented on both the orchestration solutions side and the storage/runtime/networking solutions side

### Persistent Volumes

- On a 1 node cluster hostPath volumes can be used, but on multiple node clusters the same data won’t be present on all of the nodes
- Kubernetes supports multiple storage solutions, even cloud storage solutions like Azure Disk, EBS etc.
- Persistent Volumes are cluster-wide storage volumes to be used by applications on the cluster
- Applications can make use of the Persistent Volumes using Persistent Volume Claims
- The supported `accessModes` of Persistent Volumes are:
    - ReadOnlyMany
    - ReadWriteOnce
    - ReadWriteMany
- Persistent Volumes are created with a definition file

### Persistent Volume Claims

- The administrator creates the Persistent Volumes and the users create the Persistent Volume Claims to claim the volumes for their application
- Every PVC is connected to a single PV and Kubernetes tries to claim a PV which has sufficient capacity for the PVC
    - Kubernetes also takes into account the access modes, volume modes and storage classes
    - You can also connect a PVC to a desired PV through labels and selectors
- If there are no “open” PV’s then the PVC will stay in a pending state
- When a PVC is deleted, what happens to the PV is defined by the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` defined in its specification
- If a PVC is being used by a Pod then it can’t be deleted and it will be stuck in a terminating state

### Storage Class

- When a PV is created first you have to provision disk for it, doing it by hand is called static provisioning
- With storage classes you can dynamically provision the disks
- Storage classes can substitute PV’s and can be connected to a PVC to be used by a Pod
- To use a storage class you just have to use the `storageClassName` field in the PVC spec
    - The PV is still created but it is done under the hood and you do not have to do it manually
- If the Storage Class VolumeBindingMode is set to WaitForFirstConsumer then the binding and provisioning of the PV is delayed until a consumer Pod is created
