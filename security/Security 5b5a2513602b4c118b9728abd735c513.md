# Security

### Authentication

- Kubernetes does not manage user accounts internally, but it can create ServiceAccounts for bots and third party applications
- The API Server authenticates the request before processing it
    - It can authenticate with:
        - a static username+password file
            - it can be passed to the API Server through the `--basic-auth-file` parameter
        - usernames and tokens
            - can also be passed through a parameter called `--token-auth-file`
        - certificates
        - identity services like LDAP

### TLS in Kubernetes

- Client Certificates for Clients
    - kubectl
    - kube-scheduler
    - kube-controller-manager
    - kube-proxy
- Server Certificates for Servers
    - API server
    - ETCD server
    - Kubelet srver
- Servers can and do talk to eachother (for example the API server to the ETCD server), for this communication the server can use its server certificates for communication or just create a new key pair for this purpose
- Kubernetes requires a Certificate Authority for the Cluster (but can be more than one, for example one for ETCD and one for the other components)
    - The CA itself is a key pair (ca.crt and ca.key)
        - key: private key, crt: public key

### View Certificate Details

- To view the details of a certificate use the `openssl x509 -in $CERT_PATH -text -noout` command

### Certificates API

- Kubernetes has a Certificates API which accepts CertificateSigningRequest objects which can be reviewed and approved/denied
- CSRs can be viewed with `kubectl get csr` and approved/denied with `kubectl certificate approve/deny $CSR_NAME`

Links: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#request-signing-process](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#request-signing-process)

### KubeConfig

- The KubeConfig file contains information for the kubectl tool, for example the server, client key, client certificate and the certificate authority location which are all needed for making valid requests to the API Server
- By default it looks for the configuration under `$HOME/.kube/config`
- The configuration has 3 parts:
    - Clusters
    - Contexts
    - Users
- The Contexts tie the Users and the Clusters together, for example DevUser@Production
- Kubectl knows which context to use by the `current-context` field in the configuration
- You can view the configuration with `kubectl config view` command
- You can change contexts with the `kubectl config use-context $CONTEXT` command
- You can specify a kubeconfig with the `--kubeconfig=$CONFIG_PATH` parameter
- You can also specify a namespace for a context with the `namespace` field

### Authorization

- Defines what a user can and can’t do after authenticating
- The authorization mode can be set with the `--authorization-mode` parameter of the API Server
    - It accepts a comma separated list of options and tries each option in the order specified
- There are multiple authorization mechanisms in Kubernetes:
    - Node
        - The kubelet on a Node has rights to write and read specific attributes through the API Server running on the Master Node, this mechanism is handled by the Node Authorizer
        - The kubelets certificate has to be in the `SYSTEM:NODES` group and its name has to be prefixed with `system:node`, so any user with the following ‘attributes’ has the same rights as a Node
    - ABAC
        - With attribute based authorization we associate a user with a set of permissions, to do this we create a policy file in a JSON format and pass it to the API Server, we have to do this for every user/group and when a change has to be made we have to manually edit the file and restart the API Server
    - RBAC
        - With role based authorization we create a role with a set of permissions and then associate the users with the role, this way only the role has to be modified when a change is needed
    - Webhook
        - With webhooks you can use third party solution to authorize users (Open Policy Agent for example)
    - AlwaysAllow
    - AlwaysDeny

### RBAC

- To make use of RBAC, you first have to create a Role object
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: developer
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods"]
        verbs: ["list", "get", "create", "update", "delete"]
    ```
    
    - for the Core API group you can leave the `apiGroups` attribute empty
- To links a User to a Role we have to create a RoleBinding object
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: devuser-developer-binding
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: dev-user
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: developer
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```
    
- Both Roles and RoleBindings fall under the scope of namespaces so you have the option to specify the namespace under the `metadata` section
- To see if you have the rights to do a specific action use the `kubectl auth can-i $ACTION $RESOURCE` command, for example `kubectl auth can-i delete nodes`
- As an admin user you can check if a specific user can do an action with `kubectl auth can-i $ACTION $RESOURCE --as $USER` command
    - You can also specify namespaces in this command
- You have the option to only give permissions on specific resources, to do this user the `resourceNames` list in the `rules` section of a Role definition

### Cluster Roles

- There are **namespaced** and **cluster scoped** resources in Kubernetes
    - namespaced: pods, replicasets, jobs, deployments, roles, rolebindings etc.
    - cluster scoped: nodes, PV, clusterroles, clusterrolebindings, certificatesigningrequests, namespaces
- Cluster scoped resources do not need a namespace specified for them
- To authorize a user to perform actions on cluster scoped resources, you have to use ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings
    - Both these resources are similarly structured to Roles and Rolebindings
- Both RoleBInding and ClusterRoleBinding subjects can be a ServiceAccount

- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)

### Service Accounts

- A service account is an account used by a service to access the Kubernetes Cluster, for example Prometheus
- To create a service account use the `kubectl create serviceaccount $SERVICEACCOUNT_NAME` command
- When a service account is created it creates a token for the account, which has to be used by the external service to authenticate the request
- The token is stored as a Secret object
- The token can be used as a bearer token in the request to the Kubernetes Cluster
- If the service itself is hosted in the Kubernetes Cluster, then you only have to mount the Secret to the Pod itself, instead of exporting the token
- A default service account is created for every namespace and it is mounted to every Pod in that namespace
    - If you want to use a different service account with the Pod, you can specifiy the `serviceAccountName` field in the Pod definition
- You can choose not to mount a service account to the Pod by specifying the `automountServiceAccountToken` boolean field in the Pod definition (true by default)

### Image Security

- By default Kubernetes looks for images in the Dockerhub registry
- To use an image from a private registry you have to authenticate to the registry
    - To pass the credentials to the worker Nodes first you have to create a Secret object of type `docker registry`, `kubectl create secret docker-registry $SECRET_NAME --docker-server=$SERVER --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL`
    - After creating the Secret object, add the `imagePullSecrets` field to the Pod definition and specify the name of the Secret

- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)

### Security Contexts

- When running Docker containers you can specify a user id and even Linux capabilities on the Pods. These can be done in Kubernetes too.
- To set a security context add the `securityContext` field to the Pod definition file
    - Note that this can be set both on a Pod and a container level in the definition file
    - To set capabilities, just add the `capabilities` field to the `securityContext` field, but note that capabilities can only be set at a container level

- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)

### Network Policies

- Kubernetes is by default configured to allow all traffic between Pods in the Cluster, to restrict this we use network policies
- A network policy uses selectors to connect to the Pods
- Network policies are enforced by the networking solution in the Cluster, for example Flannel does not support network policies
